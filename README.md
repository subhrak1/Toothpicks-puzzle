# Toothpicks-puzzle

Welcome to the Toothpick Puzzle, where the goal is to get an equal
number of toothpicks in each stack, in three moves.

                 Stack:  A  B  C
  Number of Toothpicks: 11  7  6

A move consists of moving toothpicks from one stack to a second stack,
where the number of toothpicks moved is exactly the number that is in the
destination stack.  In other words, to move from stack B (7 toothpicks)
to stack C (6) as shown above, we would move 6 from B to C, leaving us
with 1 in B and 12 in stack C.
